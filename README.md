Assist is a library for stochastic simulation of birth-death processes, though much of its development has been motivated by the simulation of gene regulatory networks. This library seeks to provide flexible APIs that enable the quick creation of efficient code for the simulation of birth-death processes. Presently, the library supports the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (with and without delays), and the Euler integration of Stochastic Differential Equations (with and without delays).
