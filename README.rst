A Stochastic SImulation Toolkit

Assist is a library for stochastic simulation of birth-death
processes, though much of its development has been motivated by the
simulation of gene regulatory networks. This library seeks to provide
flexible APIs that enable the quick creation of efficient code for
the simulation of birth-death processes. Presently, the library
supports the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (with and without
delays), and the Euler integration of Stochastic Differential
Equations (with and without delays).
